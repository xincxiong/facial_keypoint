## Computer Vision Capstone Project 
## Facial Keypoint Detection and Real-time Filtering

## Project Overview

In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints, as shown below.


### Amazon Web Services

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. 


### Local Environment Instructions

You should follow the AWS instructions in your classroom for best results.

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/AIND-CV-FacialKeypoints.git
cd AIND-CV-FacialKeypoints
```

2. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.5 and the `numpy` package.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda create --name aind-cv python=3.5 numpy
	source activate aind-cv
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda create --name aind-cv python=3.5 numpy scipy
	activate aind-cv
	```

3. Install/Update TensorFlow (for this project, you may use CPU only).
	- Option 1: __To install TensorFlow with GPU support__, follow [the guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system.  If you are using the Udacity AMI, you can skip this step and only need to install the `tensorflow-gpu` package:
	```
	pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.1.0
	```
	- Option 2: __To install TensorFlow with CPU support only__:
	```
	pip install tensorflow==1.1.0
	```

4. Install/Update Keras.
 ```
pip install keras -U
```

5. Switch [Keras backend](https://keras.io/backend/) to TensorFlow.
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
	python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

6. Install a few required pip packages (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Data
you can download that same training and test data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data).
